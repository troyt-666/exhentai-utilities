## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or compatible userscript manager
- Valid ExHentai/E-Hentai account
- (Optional) Hentai@Home client for H@H downloads

### Install Steps

2. Click this link: [Download Button Userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/510654-exhentai-download-button-with-batch-support)
3. Click "Install" on the Greasyfork page to confirm and install the script

## Usage

### Individual Downloads
1. Navigate to any ExHentai/E-Hentai search page
2. Each gallery will show three new buttons:
   - **Download Original**: Direct download of original archive
   - **Download Resample**: Direct download of resampled archive
   - **Download H@H**: Queue to your H@H client

### Batch Downloads
1. **Access Panel**: Click the "ðŸ“¥ Batch H@H" button in the top-right corner
2. **Select Galleries**: Check the "Batch H@H" checkbox for desired galleries
3. **Bulk Selection**: Use "Select All" or "Select None" buttons for convenience
4. **Start Download**: Click "Download Selected H@H" to begin batch processing

### Progress Monitoring
- **Live Progress**: Modal shows current gallery being processed
- **Completion Stats**: Track successful and failed downloads
- **Error Details**: View detailed error logs with timestamps

## How It Works

### Individual Downloads
1. **Gallery Page Fetch**: Retrieves the gallery page HTML
2. **Archive Link Extraction**: Locates the archive download popup link
3. **Form Processing**: Submits the appropriate download form
4. **Download Initiation**: Triggers browser download or H@H queue

### Batch Processing
1. **Sequential Processing**: Downloads are processed one at a time
2. **Rate Limiting**: 800ms delay between requests to avoid rate limiting
3. **Error Handling**: Failed downloads are logged with detailed error messages
4. **Progress Feedback**: Real-time updates on batch progress

### H@H Integration
- Submits downloads to your configured Hentai@Home client
- Uses original resolution by default (`hathdl_xres=org`)
- Provides toast notifications for queue confirmations
- Handles H@H-specific error messages

## Technical Details

### Download Types
- **Original**: Full quality archives (consumes more GP)

- **H@H**: Queued to Hentai@Home client (no GP cost)
